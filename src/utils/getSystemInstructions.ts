# Event Details
The Programming Club
Ahmedabad University
Website Making Challenge 5.0 




Date: 1st July - 7th August
Duration: 5 weeks



Concept Note 
Website Making Challenge (WMC) stands as the flagship event of the esteemed Programming Club. Since its inception in 2020, WMC has continually achieved outstanding success. Now entering its fifth edition, WMC continues the mentor-driven approach introduced in the fourth edition, ensuring participants receive regular feedback and evaluations. Each participant will select a problem to solve from a given set of problems, challenging them to create innovative websites as solutions.
Note that you can use any framework/language. Weâ€™d strongly suggest you use modern frameworks like Next.js, React, Express.js etc. rather than PHP / .NET. If youâ€™re unsure, please ask your allocated mentor or us.

(we will assign mentors to every team on the 2nd of July). 

Flow of the Event

WMC 5.0 will have four major feedback/evaluation sessions on Saturday/Sunday (6th/7th July, 20th/21st July, 27th/28th July, and 3rd August) and one open house project expo at the end, where participants will showcase their projects to all visitors. Each group will have an online meeting with their assigned mentor for 15 - 20 minutes weekly for evaluation and feedback. Participants are supposed to complete the pre-decided part on their website before the meeting with their mentor. There are going to be dedicated sessions for solving doubts from experts.

Day - 1: (1st July) WMC 5.0 and (Git and Github) Intro.

Meet 1: (6th/7th July) Participants will have to finalize a problem statement from the given problem statements. They will also provide a tech stack, a project plan, and a work division between team members to their assigned mentor. (Evaluation weightage: 5 %)

Meet 2: (20th/21st July) If you know basic HTML & CSS, then you should complete 
the websiteâ€™s authentication & database design and connection part or Learn basic 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend. (Evaluation weightage: 15 %) 

Meet 3: (27th/28th July) Feature implementation (making API routes and writing 
database queries to enable features on the frontend, and also making pages for the 
frontend) (Evaluation weightage: 15 %) 

Meet 4: (3rd/4th August) Deployment and documentation
(Evaluation weightage: 10%)

Open house Expo: (7th August) We will organize an offline exhibition at the end 
of the challenge where all the participants will get a stall to present their project to 
visitors (students as well as faculty members). This way, they can get recognition 
and essential feedback from their peers and faculties and learn how to present 
their work professionally. The Award ceremony to distribute prizes will also take 
place  at the end of the expo. A live polling booth will also allow visitors to vote for the cherry category prizes. 





Rules and General Guidelines

There are four problem statements for this competition. Each team/individual will have to choose and work on any one of the given problem statements.
Although we highly recommend using real-world data, using dummy data for your database is okay if you cannot find or recreate real-time data. 
No individual can be a part of two or more teams.
No submissions made after 6th August at 11:59 PM will be considered for evaluation. No extension will be given to any team/individual under any circumstances.
Only the entries of the participants who have registered themselves for the competition will be considered for the screening round and the final presentation.
In case your team member leaves the competition midway, you are permitted to complete the website alone. However, you cannot collaborate with any other individuals.
The website will only be considered complete if you have implemented all the primary  features. (Bonus features are optional for brownie points)
To support you guys in your journey, we have invited eight mentors. 
The Programming Club Committeeâ€™s decision will be final in case of any dispute.
A certificate of participation will be given to only those participants who submit a working prototype of a website for the problem statement allotted to them.
Each team/individual must upload their code to a remote public repository before the submission deadline.
If no teams are able to implement all the basic features, the team that has implemented the most features will be considered the winner.
Teams will be eligible for bonus points only if all basic features are implemented first.
Note: Please maintain the sanctity of the competition. Give importance to learning new concepts and frameworks over trying to win. Let's foster an environment where we can learn from each other. 
In any case, the Universityâ€™s Code of Conduct must be respected. Violating the Universityâ€™s code of conduct would lead to the participant's disqualification.


Guidelines to keep in mind while developing the project:
The competitors must create a responsive website.
The overall theme and interface of the website are up to the developer's creativity. Participants can add any extra features that they might like. Additional features are always a plus point during evaluation. 

For Dynamic Websites:
The website must have a back-end framework of the developerâ€™s choice. 
The website is required to have a Database Connection of the developerâ€™s choice. (We do not encourage you to use real-time Cloud Databases such as Google Firebase)

Whatâ€™s in it for the participants?
All the participants will learn and implement the website creation process using the latest tools and technologies. 
The Evaluation sessions will help all the participants, even if someone is a novice in this field. 
The participants can use this opportunity as a stepping stone to land an internship. 
All participants who have made a working website with all primary requirements satisfied will receive a certificate of participation. 
Winners will receive certificates and exciting goodies!


Problem Statements 
Each day from 24th to 27th of June, one problem statement will be revealed on the official Instagram account of PClub. The problem statements will be divided into three categories: Easy, Medium, and Hard, and thus the prizes will also be divided into three categories.

Please note that the following document only provides the minimum requirements for your project to qualify for the prizes. You may choose to build in as many features as you want. Please clarify any doubts you have about the programming club committee. If your submission cannot meet the minimum requirements, it will not be eligible for the major prizes. All submissions would be considered for minor prizes and swags regardless of completion status. It is, thus, recommended that you submit your progress regardless of its completion status at the end of the challenge.
